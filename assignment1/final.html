    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages
      using a markup language. HTML is an abbreviation of Hypertext and Markup
      language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup
      language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines
      the structure of web pages. HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of
      HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and has
      introduced application programming interfaces (API) and Document Object
      Model (DOM).

        An HTML file is a text file, so to create an HTML file we can use any
        text editors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Text editors are the programs which allow editing in a written text,
        hence to create a web page we need to write our code in some text
        editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are various types of text editors available which you can directly
        download, but for a beginner, the best text editor is Notepad (Windows)
        or TextEdit (Mac).

    <p>
      HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format
      and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can
      distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. <br />
      HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag.
      But some HTML tags are unclosed tags. When a web browser reads an HTML
      document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags
      are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML
      tags have different properties. An HTML file must have some essential tags
      so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text.
      You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All HTML tags must enclosed within angular these brackets.</li>
      <li>Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.</li>
      <li>
        If you have used an open tag , then you must use a close tag (except
        some tags)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a name="HTML attributes"><strong>HTML attributes</strong></a>
    <p>
      HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information
      about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.
      Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of
      that element. Attributes should always be applied with start tag. The
      Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair. The
      Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by
      W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only. You can add multiple
      attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two
      attributes.
    </p>
    <a name="HTML anchor"><strong>HTML anchor</strong></a>
    <p>
      The HTML anchor tag defines a hyperlink that links one page to another
      page. It can create hyperlink to other web page as well as files,
      location, or any URL. The "href" attribute is the most important attribute
      of the HTML a tag. and which links to destination page or URL.
    </p>
    <h4>href attribute of HTML anchor tag</h4>
    <p>
      The href attribute is used to define the address of the file to be linked.
      In other words, it points out the destination page. The syntax of HTML
      anchor tag is given below.

    <a name="HTML lists"><strong>HTML lists</strong></a>

    <p>
      HTML Lists are used to specify lists of information. All lists may contain
      one or more list elements. There are three different types of HTML lists:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ordered List or Numbered List (ol)</li>
      <li>Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul)</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Ordered List or Numbered List</h4>
    <p>
      In the ordered HTML lists, all the list items are marked with numbers by
      default. It is known as numbered list also. The ordered list starts with
      ol tag and the list items start with li tag.
    </p>
    <h4>Unordered List or Bulleted List</h4>
    <p>
      In HTML Unordered list, all the list items are marked with bullets. It is
      also known as bulleted list also. The Unordered list starts with ul tag
      and list items start with the li tag.
    </p>
    <a name="HTML table"><strong>HTML table</strong></a>
    <p>
      HTML table tag is used to display data in tabular form (row * column).
      There can be many columns in a row. We can create a table to display data
      in tabular form, using table element, with the help of tr , td, and th
      elements. In Each table, table row is defined by tag, table header is
      defined by th, and table data is defined by td tags. HTML tables are used
      to manage the layout of the page e.g. header section, navigation bar, body
      content, footer section etc. But it is recommended to use div tag over
      table to manage the layout of the page
